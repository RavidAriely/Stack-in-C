# Stack Implementation in C

A simple implementation of a stack data structure in C, designed to work with various data types, providing essential stack operations.

## Features

- Create a stack with a specified capacity and element size.
- Essential operations: push, pop, create, destroy, peek, etc.
- Check if the stack is empty.
- Chceck the current size and capacity of the stack.
- Supports different data types (int, string, etc).


## Usage

Note: by compiling the files (using makefile), a `stack.out` file will be created, which is an executable for the testing I performed.<br>
If you want to use the stack by itself, only download the `stack.c` file.

1. Clone this repository.
2. Compile the files using the makefile in the terminal:
      ```bash
      make
      ```
3. Run the executable in the terminal:
      ```bash
      ./stack.out
      ```
4. Read the comments in the `stack.h` / `stack.c` files to understand what each function does.
